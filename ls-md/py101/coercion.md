Coercion is also know in other languages as _casting_. It is the process of changing the data type of an object. 

Coercion like the examples above is [[explicit_coercion]] where the programmer is intentional about the actions taken on the objects to change their data type. There is also the concept of [[implicit_coercion]], which a programmer has to be on the look out for  a bit more, sine this one happens without explicit calls to methods like `int()` or `str()`.
