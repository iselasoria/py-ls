Collections are [[container]] data types that hold other data types.
They are _NOT_ indexed, unlike [[sequences]]. All sequences are collections, but not all collections are sequences.

> Collection and Sequence
```python
lst = ['Burbus', 'Gotita', 'Espumin']
```
> Collection Only

```pyhton
student = {'name' : 'Blanche', 'surname' : 'Deveraux', 'age' : None}
```

Note that a [[dictionary]] is not an ordered collection, but as of more receny python versions, it does preserve the order of insertion into the collection.
