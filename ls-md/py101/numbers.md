## Integers
[[integers]] are numbers that don't have a decimal point, such as 2, 5, 8.

## Floats
Floats, or floating point numbers, are those that have a decimnal point, such as 4.5, 3.3, 2.0.

Through the use of operators, we can have [[implicit coercion]]. This type of [[coercion]] happens as a byproduct of running operations on numric types and is not obviously state by the program, as is the case with [[explicit coercion]].
