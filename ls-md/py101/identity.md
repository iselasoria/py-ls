The concept of identity refers to the unique address in memory that an object is assigned upon [[instantiation]]. The unique address can be obtained with `id()`.

```python
kitty_boy = 'Denali'

print(id(kitty_boy)) # 4553550192
```

No two object will have the same _object id_ if they are different instances of the [[class]].
