Conceptual Questions:

    1.    Iterables and Concatenation:
    •    Why does attempting to concatenate a list and a tuple directly result in a TypeError? How can you resolve this issue?
    2.    Unary * Operator:
    •    What is the purpose of the unary * operator in Python, and how does it simplify working with iterables?
    •    Give an example of how the unary * operator can be used with a function that takes multiple arguments.
    3.    Nested Unpacking:
    •    Explain what nested unpacking is and provide a scenario where it can be useful.
    4.    Using the * Operator Judiciously:
    •    Why might it be more appropriate to use the built-in set function rather than the * operator when converting a list to a set?
    5.    Unary ** Operator for Dictionaries:
    •    How does the unary ** operator assist with dictionary operations, and in what scenarios is it particularly useful?
