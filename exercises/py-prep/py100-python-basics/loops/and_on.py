# The following code keeps looping forever. (You can hit Ctrl-C to stop it.) 
# Why does the loop keep running? Modify it so that it stops after the first iteration.

while True:
    print("and on")
    break

# this is an infinite loop because there is no condition that breaks out of it,
#  such as a predetermined length of a collection, or a creak statement.
