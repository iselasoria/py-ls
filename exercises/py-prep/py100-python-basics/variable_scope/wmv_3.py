# what will the code do adn why?
def my_function():
    a = 1

    if True:
        print(a)

my_function()


# the function is defined and has a local variable a set to integer 1
# the subsequent condition will always be true, and theregore the print statement 
# will get executed each time. So, by the time we call the function, the code will output 1
